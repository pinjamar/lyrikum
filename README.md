# Project Lyrikum

Develop an elegant React.js Music Application. This is a practice project that uses React, Redux, Tailwind and RapidAPI. You will have to use a lot of "states" and "hooks" so it is really a cool project. There are currently some minor issues with Shazam Core API (which is used here) as it is no longer freemium and there are constant updates to the API which sometimes cause app to crash if it is not updated to the newest version of the API path. Below you can read all that you need to know about how to start using this project.
